<H2>Pass feature data to the shell</h2>

<p>
This plugin is designed to pass feature data to your shell ("/bin/sh" on 
unix or linux machines, "c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe" on windows). Properly
employed, it can speed and simplify many common QGIS tasks which would 
otherwise would take lots of typing and mouse clicking.

<a id="Configuring"><h2>Configuring</h2></a>

<p>
The ShellDB <b>Configure</b> choice is where you tell ShellDB what
command you wish to run and what feature data you wish to pass to it.
If you click the <b>Configure</b> menu choice, you'll see the <b>Shell
Script Plugin Setup</b> panel. Click the <b>Find Script</b> button to
bring up a file menu where you can select the script to which you wish
to pass feature data.  You can also type a shell command directly in
to the <b>Shell Command Line</b> box on this panel. Command lines run
with their current directory set to the directory portion of the
command line.  Hence, the command "/home/devel/qmaps/shell/echo_id.sh"
will run with its current working directory as
"/home/devel/qmaps/shell".  This makes it easy to reference files
inside your scripts relative to the location of the script itself. If
you run a program from the $PATH (such as "echo"), then ShellDB sets
its current working directory to your ${HOME}.
</p>

<p>
Next, you'll pick the vector layer where the features you're working
with reside. Do this by clicking on its name from the <b>Map
Layers:</b> list. When you click on this name, the names of the fields
in its backing store will appear in the <b>Data Fields:</b> list.
Right now, alas, you can only work with one vector layer at a time in
this plugin.
</p>

<p>

Now you're ready to pick the data fields you wish to pass to the
shell.  When you click on a member of the <b>Data Fields:</b> list,
you'll see it appear surrounded by "@@" in the <b>Shell Command
Line</b> field.  You can, of course simply add "@@fieldname@@" to
the <b>Shell Command Line</b> field if you wish. If you mess this up,
the template string will simply be passed whole to your shell script
(e.g. if you specify "@@FOO@@" when you meant "@@BAR@@", your script
will see "@@FOO@@" rather than the contents of the "BAR" data
field). If the field you're going to pass to the shell contains spaces
or other characters special to your shell, such as "$" or "!" in bash
or sh, you will need to surround the "@@fieldname@@" in the <b>Shell
Command Line</b> box with single or double-quotes to ensure it is
properly passed to your shell script.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to run a specific command once for each batch of features
you select, you can use the <b>Find batch level script</b> button to
fill in the <b>Batch Level Script</b> line in this panel. When you
select a bunch of fields in QGIS to run a command against, the script
you select here will run before the commands involving those
fields. You will see its name first in the <b>edit commands</b> dialog
box when you hit the <b>run</b> button as explained below.  This is
very useful if you need to set a parameter (such as an anomaly type)
for every feature in a group which you have selected, or if you are 
grouping features by selected batches (as, for example, in a spreadsheet
where you plan to do further edits on feature data).
</p>
<p>

You are now ready to start picking features with the <b>select</b>
feature of QGIS and passing them to the shell with the <b>Run</b>
choice in the ShellDB plugin.  You have a few other options before
doing so, however.  You can use the <b>Find Log File</b> button to
fill out the <b>Log File</b> text box, if you want ShellDB to keep a
log of the stdout and stderr streams from your shell script.  This can
be handy if you have errors in your shell script, although of course
there's nothing to prevent you from logging things inside your script,
separate from this facility.  If you check the <b>Delete Processed
Features</b> radio button, ShellDB will delete features from your map
after it has processed them; this is very handy if you're doing a lot
of map features and need to keep track of what you have and have not
done. This feature will, however, permanently delete features from
your map (better work on a copy of it then).  If you leave the <b>Edit
Commands</b> button clicked in ShellDB's configuration, then ShellDB
will display a text editor to allow you to examine or change the shell
commands it has created before running them.
</p>
<p>
ShellDB keeps its configuration in your QGIS project, so once you save
your project you won't have to reconfigure ShellDB when you bring it
back up. It stores all the file names you choose in the
configuration panel as <i>relative</i> paths, but uses and displays
them as <i>absolute</i> paths.  This means that you can put a QGIS
project and any scripts you use with it on a memory stick and move it
to another machine and still have them all work correctly, assuming
that they are all in the directory tree you transferred (and all the
files <i>they</i> reference are through relative path names as well).
If you reference scripts on a different disk on a Windows machine, of
course, this won't work.  If you bring up ShellDB's configuration
panel and see a relative path, it probably means that ShellDB cannot
find the file named in that field.  If the configuration dialog
completely fails ( by giving a python error message), you can manually
edit the .qgs file to remove or change the &lt;ShellDB&gt; stanza in
the project xml.
</p>

<a id="Running"><h2>Running</h2></a>
<p>
After you have configured ShellDB, you can create shell commands and
run them on features you have selected.  To do this, use
the <b>select</b> tool to select the features you wish to run commands
against, then click on the <b>Run</b> choice from the ShellDB menu
choice.  If you have the <b>Edit Commands</b> radio button selected in
the <b>Configure</b> panel, you'll see an edit box pop up in the
middle of your screen with the command lines you're about to pass to
the shell.  You can edit your command lines here, but don't delete
commands or change their order; doing so will cause internal errors in
ShellDB.
</p>

<p>
After you press <b>OK</b> in the command edit screen, the commands
you have constructed will run and your map will re-draw, possibly with
the features you processed deleted. You can then select more features
and select <b>Run</b> to process more map features through ShellDB.

<h3>Error Messages</h3>

<h4>OS Error</h4>
<p>
An operating system error occurred while ShellDB was trying to pass
command lines to the shell.  The exact error should appear in the
message box. The most common error is a file not found error, when the
script is not where ShellDB thinks it is.  This error will halt all
further processing of command lines.
</p>

<h4>No features Selected</h4>
<p>
You selected to Run the ShellDB plugin but provided no selected
features for it to process.
</p>

<h4>Not Configured</h4>
<p>
You tried to run the ShellDB plugin before it was configured.  This
message can also appear if you have deleted the layer for which
ShellDB is configured.
</p>
<h4>Commandline Failure</h4>
<p>
One or more of the command lines you ran in this group of selected
features has returned an errorlevel other than 0.  This doesn't stop
processing; subsequent commands will run.  If you configured a ShellDB
log file, you can look in it for additional information on what
happened. If the <b>Delete Processed Features</b> radio button is set,
ShellDB will not delete features corresponding to command lines with
non-0 errorlevels.
</p>

<h4>Read-only Layer</h4>
<p>
Setting a query on a vector layer turns it read-only. ShellDB will
kvetch if you have selected to <b>Delete Processed Features</b> If you
lack privilege to write to a shape file or database table, you will
also get this error.
</p>

<h4>Missing Layer</h4>
<p>
If you remove the layer which ShellDB is working on and then re-add it
to your project, ShellDB will not be able to find the layer. This is
because QGis layer names include the date and time they were created,
in order to you to add two or more layers with the same display name.
To fix this trouble, re-select the layer (with its new timestamp
value) which you are working on in the <b>Map Layers:</b> line of
ShellDB's <b>Configure</b> panel.
</p>

<h4>Logfile Trouble</h4>
<p>
If ShellDB cannot find her log file, she will notify you of this fact
and continue to march.  Fix the <b>Log File</b> line in
ShellDB's <b>Configure</b> panel to fix this.
